# MERN Stack Real-Time Chat Application

## Overview

This project is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application allows users to engage in instant messaging with secure user authentication. It integrates Socket.io for real-time communication and uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions. The front end is designed using React with state management handled by Redux, while MongoDB serves as the database for storing user and chat data.
